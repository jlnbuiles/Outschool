# Outschool - GraphQL

This is a sample project that shows how we can integrate GraphQL into a small iOS app.

### Project Structure
- Outschool - Actual app source code
  - Apollo Data layer - All the apollo config files. (Except schema)
  - Application - General app classes. App & Scene delegates
  - Modules - All user workflows/modules would be contained here
    - Classes - The classes module. which is the only module of this app exercise
  - Utils - A place for general utility classes
  - Extensions - A place where generic extensions belong
- Outschool Tests - Unit tests. This is where I tested the Cell's rating label
